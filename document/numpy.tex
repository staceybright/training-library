\section{The Uses of NumPy }
NumPy is a Python module which adds support for large,
multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large library of
high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy
addresses the problems of speed in interpreting languages by providing
multi-dimensional arrays and lots of functions and operators that
operate on arrays. Any algorithm that can be expressed primarily as
operations on arrays and matrices can run almost as fast as the
equivalent C code.

\subsection{NumPy's array vs. Python's built-in list}
NumPy introduces new data types, but the most popular, versatile, and
useful one is the array.  This is similar to arrays in IDL.  There
are several reasons why you would want to use a NumPy array over
Python's built-in list.
\begin{itemize}
\item NumPy, PyLab, SciPy, PyFITS and other modules' functions often
  work with NumPy arrays.
\item Every item in a NumPy array is of the same data type.  This
  means there is less information to keep track of which makes array
  computations faster.
\item NumPy arrays act as vectors and therefore we can do things such
  as element-wise addition and multiplication.
\end{itemize}

To convert a list to an array, use {\sf \small numpy.array()}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  numpy.array
\subsection{ {\sf numpy.array() } function}
  {\color{blue} {\sf\small USE}} \\
  The {\sf\small numpy.array()} function converts a list to a NumPy
  array.  

{\color{blue} {\sf\small EXAMPLES}} \\
\begin{alltt}
\pytab import numpy as np
\pytab a = [1,2,3,4]      #a python built in list 
\pytab b = np.array(a)     #converted to a NumPy array 
\pytab print a 
\pytab print b 
\pytab indx = [1,2] 
\pytab print b[indx]  
\pytab print b[1:3]       #prints elements 1 to 2, NOT 1 to 3.  
\pytab print b[:3], b[3:] #prints up to the 3rd element, \textbackslash
\ldots    and then everything after the 3rd element.
\pytab print b[-1],b[-2] 
\pytab print b[::-1]      #reverses the array.  
\pytab c = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10]]) 
\pytab print c 
\pytab print c[1,3]       #indices for a multi-dimensional array 
\pytab print c[1][3]      #this is slower than the previous as it \textbackslash
\ldots    creates a new array, $c[1]$, and then subscripts that array.
\pytab print c[1,:]  #print the first element in the first \textbackslash
\ldots    dimension, but all in the second dimension
\pytab print c[:,1] 
\end{alltt}
Notice when we print lists and arrays that the elements in lists are
separated by commas while the elements in arrays are only separated by
spaces.

{\color{blue} {\sf\small EXERCISES}} \\
{\it Exercise \arabic{exercise} \stepcounter{exercise}:  \\
  Create a list $a$ and a NumPy array $b$.  Multiply each by 2 and
  explain what happens.  Now add 2 to each array.  Again, explain the
  result.  } \\
{\it Exercise \arabic{exercise} \stepcounter{exercise}:  \\
  Create a third list $c$.  Add $c$ to both $a$ and
  $b$.  Explain the result.}

\section{What a NumPy array really is and a word of caution}

A final note about NumPy arrays is that an array is actually
an object which points to a block of memory.  For example, in the
above exercise we created an array $b$.  Try the following:

\texttt{\pytab d = b}

Now we just created a second array, $d$.  Instead of using up twice
the memory space, $d$ is just a pointer to the memory $b$ also points
to (remember, we copied an array, and an array is a pointer).  Again,
try the following:
\begin{alltt}
\pytab d[2] = 999 
\pytab print d 
\pytab print b 
\end{alltt}
Notice what happened to $b$.  While it saves on memory space,
programmers have to be careful.  If you know you will want to change
one array and not the other, the correct function to use is {\sf
  numpy.copy()}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  numpy.copy
\subsection{ {\sf numpy.copy() } function}
\label{s:copy}
{\color{blue} {\sf\small USE}} \\
The {\sf\small numpy.copy()} function copies the contents of the
memory space the array points to. 

{\color{blue} {\sf\small EXAMPLES}} \\
Try the code below and notice the difference in the results from a
simple $d = b$ assignment.
\begin{alltt}
\pytab import numpy as np
\pytab a = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]) 
\pytab b = a.copy()  
\pytab b[2] = 999  
\pytab print b  
\pytab print a
\pytab a.size
\pytab a.shape
\end{alltt}

\section{Other Common NumPy Functions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  numpy.arange
\subsection{ {\sf numpy.arange() } function}
{\color{blue} {\sf\small USE}} \\
The {\sf\small numpy.arange()} function creates an integer array
from zero to the `stop' parameter given, with a step size of one.
The `start' and `step' can also be specified.  By setting the parameter
`dtype' we can change the data type of the array (i.e. to float).

{\color{blue} {\sf\small EXAMPLES}} 
\begin{alltt}
\pytab import numpy as np 
\pytab np.arange(10) 
\pytab 1 + np.arange(10, dtype=float) * 4 
\pytab np.arange(1,40,4,dtype=float)
\end{alltt}
{\color{blue} {\sf\small SEE ALSO}} \\
A similar function for lists is {\sf\small range()}.

{\color{blue} {\sf\small EXERCISES}} \\
{\it Exercise \arabic{exercise} \stepcounter{exercise}:  \\
Create the  sequence 0.1, 0.2,0.3, ... 1.4  using {\sf\small
  numpy.arange()}.  Hint: As noted in the NumPy documentation for
numpy.arange(), it is best to use integer step sizes.} \\
{\it Exercise \arabic{exercise} \stepcounter{exercise}:  \\
Create the  sequence -3.2, -3.0, -2.8, ... -1.0  using {\sf\small
  numpy.arange()}.  See above hint.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  numpy.empty
\subsection{ {\sf numpy.empty() } function}
{\color{blue} {\sf\small USE}} \\
The {\sf\small numpy.empty()} function creates a float array of the
specified dimensions. Each element of the array is whatever was left
in that memory space, therefore it is fast but useful only if you know
you will assign each element a meaningful value.
  
{\color{blue} {\sf\small EXAMPLES}} 
\begin{alltt}
\pytab import numpy as np 
\pytab np.empty(10)   #pass an argument, which is the dimensions
\pytab np.empty((3,4)) #here it is 2D, so the dimensions \textbackslash
\ldots    we pass is a tuple
\end{alltt}

{\color{blue} {\sf\small SEE ALSO}} \\
Other useful similar functions are {\sf\small numpy.zeros(), numpy.ones()}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  numpy.where
\subsection{ {\sf numpy.where() } function}
{\color{blue} {\sf\small USE}} \\
The {\sf\small numpy.where()} function returns an array (or a tuple of
arrays) of the indices where the condition is $True$.  Otherwise, if you
specify substitute values, it will return an array of the same shape as
the original with the first value substituted where the condition is
$True$, and the second value substituted where the condition is $False$.
  
{\color{blue} {\sf\small EXAMPLES}} 
\begin{alltt}
\pytab import numpy as np
\pytab a = np.arange(11, dtype=float) + 1
\pytab b = np.where(a >= 8.) 
\pytab print b 
\pytab a[b] 
\pytab a = np.array([1,2,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,4]) 
\pytab b = np.where(a == 1, 1,0) 
\pytab print b 
\end{alltt}
If we do not need the indices from {\sf\small numpy.where()} then we
can just use creative indexing for the same effect.
\begin{alltt}
\pytab a > 5
\pytab a[a>5]
\end{alltt}

{\color{blue} {\sf\small SEE ALSO}} \\
Other useful similar functions are {\sf\small numpy.any(),
  numpy.all(), numpy.nonzero(), numpy.choose()}.
 
{\color{blue} {\sf\small EXERCISES}} \\
{\it Exercise \arabic{exercise} \stepcounter{exercise}:  \\
Create a random real 10-element array with numbers between 0 and 1.
Select those with counts lower than 0.5.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  numpy.loadtxt
\subsection{ {\sf numpy.loadtxt() } function}
\label{ss:loadtxt}

{\color{blue} {\sf\small USE}} \\
The {\sf\small numpy.loadtxt()} function reads in a table of data
from a specified file.  With the `unpack' flag set the output is the
transverse of the original output and can be assigned to multiple
arrays.  As an example we will use the file: 

/grp/jwst/wit/miri/randers/PythonTraining/Gordon2005\_Fig16.txt. 

This data is from Figure 16 from Gordon, K. D., et al. 2005, PASP,
117, 503.  Here we will read in the data, and in
Chapter~\ref{ch:pylab} we will replicate the plots.

The plots are of the uncertainties in the y-intercept and
slope calculations respectively.  The lines are the results of 10,000
trials of simulated data with only random errors included, only
correlated errors included, and both included.  The circles are the
results from  equation A30.  The plot demonstrates how well the
equation fits the simulated data. 

{\color{blue} {\sf\small EXERCISES}} \\
{\it Exercise \arabic{exercise} \stepcounter{exercise}:  \\
  Open Gordon2005\_Fig16.txt in your favorite text editor.  Look at the
  commented line and see if you can understand the labels there given
  the description above.}

{\color{blue} {\sf\small EXAMPLES}} \\
\begin{alltt}
\pytab import numpy as np 
\pytab infile = 'Gordon2005_Fig16.txt' 
\pytab data = np.loadtxt(infile) 
\pytab print data 
\pytab print 'Data shape: ',data.shape  
\pytab slope, ran_slope_unc, corr_slope_unc, both_slope_unc,  \textbackslash
\ldots     eqn_slope_unc, ran_yint_unc, corr_yint_unc, both_yint_unc,  \textbackslash
\ldots     eqn_yint_unc = np.loadtxt(infile, unpack=True) 
\pytab print 'Slope: ', slope 
\pytab print 'Slope shape: ',slope.shape  
\pytab yint_data = np.loadtxt(infile,usecols=(0,5,6,7,8)) 
\pytab print 'Y-intercept data only: ',yint_data  
\pytab print 'Slope: ',yint_data[:,0]  
\pytab print 'Yint data shape: ',yint_data.shape 
\pytab yint_data2 =  \textbackslash
\ldots     np.loadtxt(infile,usecols=(0,5,6,7,8),unpack=True)  
\pytab print 'Yint data shape with unpack: ',yint_data2.shape
\end{alltt}

Notice that when we leave $unpack$ set to $False$, the shape is [rows,
columns], while when we do unpack, the shape is [columns, rows].

{\color{blue} {\sf\small SEE ALSO}} \\
Other useful similar functions are {\sf\small numpy.savetxt()}.

Now that we have a set of data, we will make a plot of this data in
Chapter~\ref{ch:pylab}.
