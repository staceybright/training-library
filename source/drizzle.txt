DrizzlePac is a python package used for spatially aligning and combining Hubble Space Telescope (HST) image data.  It was created to replace and improve upon the functionality of MultiDrizzle.  The main workhorse of DrizzlePac is the task AstroDrizzle.  This task provides many improvements to HST images, creating cleaner  images and allowing for much more accurate photometry.  In fact, DrizzlePac/the AstroDrizzle algorithms have been used to create many of your favorite famous HST images!

This intention of this document is to give a basic overview of the DrizzlePac workflow for HST images.  Over the course of this training, you will find a number of exercises.  Please save any plots/meaningful output so you trainers may review your work.  For more information on AstroDrizzle/DrizzlePac consult the `DrizzlePac webpage <http://drizzlepac.stsci.edu/>`_ and the many links presented there.

Introduction
============
The original Drizzle algorithm was created to combine the many exposures used to create the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.  Since then the software has gone through many iterations to become DrizzlePac, which offers a wide variety of tools to correct, align, and combine images.

Until now, you may have only looked at image data processed solely by the calibration pipelines (calwf3, calacs).  AstroDrizzle takes the individual products of these pipelines and makes a final, improved product that may have corrected several things including but not limited to:

    * Geometric distortion
    * Bad Pixels
    * Cosmic rays
    * Blobs
    * Chip gaps
Drizzle is able to fill in pixels affected by these artifacts by replacing them with other 'good' pixels in your stack.

Geometric Distortion
--------------------
To correct for the spherical aberration of Hubble's primary mirror, corrective optics were required to produce usable data.  In the current generation of imagers, this correction causes distortion in the cameras' field of view, as the detectors are tilted relative to the focal plane.  This, in turn, creates a slight pixel area gradient across the detectors as well as a skewed, non-rectangular field of view.  In this state, astrometric alignments/measurements are near impossible.  AstroDrizzle is able to correct for this using distortion correction reference files provided by the instrument teams at STScI.

Detector Artifacts
---------------------------------
The detectors aboard both ACS and WFC3 feature a small, but non-negligible, number of pixels classified as 'bad'.  These may be warm/hot pixels, unstable pixels, unbonded pixels, or pixels that are entirely dead.  In the case of WFC3/IR blemishes with lower than expected sensitivity ('blobs') are created by issues elsewhere in the optical path.  These pixels are generally detrimental to obtaining good, photometrically accurate images. In addition, cosmic rays are constantly bombarding the detectors.  Due to the high energies of these particles HST images show bright speckles/streaks (which do not correspond to any real source), especially in images with longer exposure times.  Instrument channels featuring multiple detector chips, such as WFC3/UVIS and ACS/WFC, have gaps in-between the chips (chip gaps).  These gaps are the width of several pixels so single exposures from these instrument channels are bisected by a gap in which no data is recorded (as there are no pixels there).

To fix these issues, dithered exposures are taken in flight and combined later by AstroDrizzle.

Dithering
---------
Dithering is the repointing of the telescope within a single visit to shift targets onto different pixels from exposure to exposure (an example showing dithered exposures of NGC-1856 is provided below).

.. image:: figures/drizzle/Visit01-icb701oqq_flt.jpg
    :scale: 8 %
    :alt: first_exposure
.. image:: figures/drizzle/Visit01-icb701p0q_flt.jpg
    :scale: 8 %
    :alt: second_exposure

This process moves sources that may have been on problematic pixels onto pixels unaffected by detector artifacts.  Notice in the example above how the target moves across the chip gap, so the regions of the target placed in the gap in the first exposure can be recorded in the following exposure.  Bad pixels in a single exposure are rejected and filled in with good pixels from other exposures when multiple exposures are ultimately combined in the Drizzle process.

In addition, dithering subpixel distances can allow for better sampling of the point spread function (PSF).  This PSF subsampling can be used to achieve a higher resolution in the final Drizzled image.


Drizzle Process
---------------
The actual process used to 'drizzle' and image consists of several steps.  Roughly, they are:

0. Alignment of input images                        (TweakReg)
1. Create bad pixel mask    (AstroDrizzle)
#. Sky subtraction (AstroDrizzle)
#. Drizzle single undistorted images (AstroDrizzle)
#. Create median image (AstroDrizzle)
#. Blot median image back to distorted frame (AstroDrizzle)
#. Create cosmic ray mask (AstroDrizzle)
#. **Create final undistorted, combined image** (AstroDrizzle)
#. PROFIT!!!! (Science/pretty pictures)

Before any drizzling is actually done, images must be properly aligned.  The alignment process uses a module in DrizzlePac called TweakReg.

Steps one through seven are the main steps of the AstroDrizzle process.  Steps one through three remove distortion and reject any permanently 'bad' pixels (dead pixels, blobs, etc) whereas steps four through six flag and reject cosmic rays.  Step 7 creates the final optimized drizzled product which can be used for step 8 at your leisure.

Alignment using TweakReg
========================

Images taken within the same visit are usually aligned (registered) to each other and often do not need to be registered.  However, uncertainties in the guide star catalog introduce errors in the pointing of the telescope, so images taken in separate visits should not be assumed to be aligned.  An example of misaligned images is shown below:

.. image:: figures/drizzle/misaligned_source.png
    :scale: 75 %
    :alt: misaligned_image

The first image (shown in red)is clearly offset from the second (shown in cyan) by nearly 10 pixels (roughly an arcsecond).  In general an alignment within 0.1 pixels is considered good.

Pixel positions are mapped to positions on the sky (RA/Dec) via the world coordinate system (WCS).  Naturally, the positions of sources **should** have the same celestial coordinates between exposures (this obviously isn't always the case for objects with large proper motions).  Misaligned images like the example above show the same sources having different celestial positions- an error that must be rectified before running AstroDrizzle.  To do this, the WCS of the input images must be 'tweaked' so the positions of the sources match across all of the images.

The zeroth step in the drizzle process is making sure the images are aligned.  This remainder of this section will guide you through aligning images using TweakReg.  The example images we use feature the open cluster NGC 6791.

Open some of the images in ds9 and press ``Match -> Frame -> WCS``.  Notice that images from the Visit 01 (``ibnh01*flt.fits``) are well aligned to one another, but images from the Visit 09 (``ibnh09*flt.fits``) are not aligned with Visit 01.


TweakReg
--------
The alignment process via TweakReg consists of a few steps:

1. Make a catalog of point source pixel positions for each input image and reference image via a source finding algorithm similar to IRAF's ``DAOFIND`` task
#. Convert the pixel position catalogs to sky position catalogs (accounting for geometric distortion)
#. Find common source positions between reference and input image catalogs
#. Calculate the shifts, rotation and scale needed to align sky positions of sources in the input images
#. Update the input image headers with the newly calculated WCS information

You can run TweakReg through Pyraf or Python, though it's recommended to stick to Python (as Pyraf/IRAF support is being discontinued by STScI).  Enter the ``SSBX`` environment and open a python shell of your choice (ipython/ipython notebook will likely work the best).  Many tasks that originated from IRAF (such as the tasks in DrizzlePac) be run through the ``teal`` GUI ::

>>> import glob
>>> from stsci.tools import teal
>>> from drizzlepac import tweakreg
>>> teal.teal('tweakreg')

Though not practical for scripting, the GUIs are helpful when learning how to use the tasks.  Clearly, there are many parameters to play with, but for now we'll go over the most important ones.  In the tweakreg parameters window:

    * Set the input parameter to ``*flt.fits``.  These are the input images
    * Set the updatewcs parameter to ``Yes`` so TweakReg can incorporate the geometric distortion into the alignment.
    * Set the refimage parameter to ``ibnh01z2q_flt.fits`` (or any one of the other input images).  All of the input images will be aligned to the refimage.
    * Set expand_refcat to ``Yes``.  This allows TweakReg to add unmatched sources from input images to the reference image source catalog on the fly (this is great for mosaicking!).
    * Set enforce_user_order to ``No``.  This lets TweakReg come up with a good order of input images when computing alignment transformations.

The first (and probably most important) step of TweakReg is building a catalog of sources in the input and reference images.  The relevant parameters for this step are within the *imagefind Parameters* and *refimagefind Parameters* sections:

    * Press the **refimagefind Parameters** button and set conv_width to ``3.5`` for WFC3/UVIS and ACS/WFC (``2.5`` for WFC3/IR).
    * For peakmin and peakmax use an image viewer (such as DS9 or ATV) to inspect the cores of the stars and set these parameters based on the range of values you see.  These parameters set the brightness cutoffs for stars used in alignment.
    * For WFC3/UVIS and ACS/WFC set the threshold high (try ``100.0`` for now) to avoid detection cosmic rays and faint sources.
    * Press **Save & Quit** then the **imagefind Parameters** button and input the same values from the **refimagefind Parameters** GUI.  This tells TweakReg how to do source finding for the input images.

You can now run TweakReg from this GUI by pressing **Execute**, or you can run via python command.  To do the latter press **Save & Quit** and type in your python shell: ::

>>> tweakreg.TweakReg(glob.glob('*flt.fits'))

The parameter values you populated in the GUI are saved and used when you call TweakReg through the command.  However, if you do not want to use the GUI at all, you can set all of the parameters within the TweakReg call: ::

    >>> findpars = {'threshold':100.,'conv_width':3.5,'peakmin':1000.,'peakmax':40000.}
    # Parameters in sub parameter windows are passed as dictionaries
    >>> tweakreg.TweakReg(glob.glob('*flt.fits'), expand_refcat=True, enforce_user_order=False,
    ...                   updatewcs=True, refimage='ibnh01z2q_flt.fits', imagefindcfg=findpars,
    ...                   refimagefindcfg=findpars)

TweakReg will then output a number of messages detailing the sources, matches, and shifts that were found and will also make plots that help indicate the quality of alignment solution:

.. image:: figures/drizzle/hist2d_ibnh09a5q_flt.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :alt: histogram_2d
.. image:: figures/drizzle/vector_ibnh09a5q_flt.png
    :scale: 35 %
    :alt: vector_residuals

.. image:: figures/drizzle/residuals_ibnh09a5q_flt.png
    :scale: 100 %
    :alt: histogram_2d

Coach made some plots, explain dis later pl0x

If the residuals do not show any systematics and are small enough to indicate good alignments then TweakReg can be rerun with the updatehder set to ``Yes`` in the GUI or given as the keyword ``updatehdr=True`` in the call from python.  When all the images are aligned, you can then proceed to run AstroDrizzle.
