Welcome to the RIA Training Library!
#####################################

New Research & Instrument Analysts at STScI work with a variety of tools, depending on their instrument team and (for some) their research assignments. Nevertheless, some things are so generally useful to RIAs that we've drawn up training documents to bring you up to speed on anything you haven't used before. (Perhaps you'll even learn new tricks for things you *have* used before!)

This library also contains a collection of :doc:`tricks`, generally computing related. When you reach the end of your training, your final task will be to contribute an improvement to the training library. This could be a tip, a clarification for part of the training that you found confusing, or something else.
