PART I: Searching the Archive
=============================

In your work here at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), you
will likely use archival data often. So it is important to be able to
navigate the various archives that can be found in MAST (the Mikulski
Archive for Space Telescopes), which covers a plethora of space
telescope missions. We will be using MAST, Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA),
and Starview to retrieve data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). So
let's begin! Along the way, I will ask you to answer some questions and
perform some exercises. **Please keep a record of your answers to show
when completed.**

The MAST/HST archive can be searched from the following interface found at http://archive.stsci.edu/hst/search.php.

Search for ACS data (using the "Standard Form")
-----------------------------------------------

a) Type *47Tuc* in the *Target* box, with *Resolver* set to *Resolve*. In the *Filters/Gratings* box, enter ``*606*``. The asterisk (``*``) works as a wild card and can be used when you don't know the exact syntax of the field. To specify the detector, enter ``*wfc*`` in the *Aperture* field. Note that you can also click each entry title for more information on the proper syntax. Save a list of these datasets in an *HTML\_Table* (which is the default setting for the *Output Format*).

   Figure 1 portrays what the MAST search form should look like:

   .. figure:: figures/archives/mast_standard_form.png

      Figure 1: This is a facsimile of what the "Standard Form" MAST search
      request should look like.

   Click on the *Search* button and you should get a new page with *HST
   Search Results* at the top with the datasets that match your search
   criterion. You will notice in the search results that this target is
   also called *NGC104*. Figure 2 shows the search results for this query.

   .. figure:: figures/archives/acs_search_results.png

      Figure 2: This figure shows the results from the NGC104 ACS search.

   Your search should have returned a list containing these Datasets::

      J6LL01YCQ
      J8ISA10E1
      J9L960010
      J8F864020

b) Using the same search criteria, change the *Target Name* field to
   *ngc104* with *Resolver* set to *Don't Resolve* and *Records per Page*
   set to *500*. Please pay attention to the "number of rows returned" at
   the top of the search results page.

   .. admonition:: Question 1
      :class: note

      How many datasets were retrieved from the query in part b?


c) Now do the same search, but include wildcards in the target name
   *ngc\*104\**. Notice how many rows were returned and think about why the
   number may be different. Sort the columns by *Target Name* by clicking
   on the column header. Note that the last dataset (J96G03010) is actually
   a different target that was found because of the wildcard search! So be
   careful!

   .. admonition:: Question 2
      :class: note

      How many datasets were retrieved for the query in part c?


d) Modify your search again to include only the observations that
   executed after the ACS repair in 2009 (Start Time = *>01-01-2009*) that
   have exposure times between 30 and 100 seconds (Exp Time = *30 .. 100*).

   .. admonition:: Question 3
      :class: note

      How many datasets were retrieved for the query in part d?

e) Using the *Output Columns* selector box, try adjusting the search
   results page columns. Remove output columns so that only the *Dataset*,
   *Target Name*, and *Start Time* will be returned. Additionally sort the
   search results by *Start Time*, *Target Name*, and *Dataset* using the
   *Sort By* section on the search page. Save this search in an output file
   by using the *File: tab-separated values* under *Output Format*. Please
   **save the resulting file** as <your\_name>\_hst\_search.txt, to be
   turned in to your instructor.

   Note that the Datasets returned on the *HST Search Results* page are
   clickable. The link will open a new page containing a preview image and
   exposure information, which can be quite useful!

Search for STIS data (using the "File Upload Form")
---------------------------------------------------

a) Create a text file that contains the following Datasets (one per
   line) to be used as your input list::

      O8J502280
      O8J502290
      O8J5022A0
      O8J5022B0
      O8J5022C0
      O8J5022D0
      O8J5022E0

b) On the HST Search Form, click on the *File Upload Form*. This will
   bring up the search form as shown in Figure 3.

c) Pay attention to the following: *Local File Name* (this will point to
   the text file containing the Datasets), the button *File Contents*,
   which allows for mining MAST using Coordinates, Target Names, and Data
   ID, and the button *RA, Target or Data ID Column*, which defines what
   kind of data is in the first column or another column (you select on 1
   of 10 columns in the upload text file). Figure 3 shows the parameter
   settings needed for the MAST search that is required for retrieval of
   the STIS data in your text file.

   .. figure:: figures/archives/mast_file_upload.png

      Figure 3: This is a facsimile of what the "File Upload Form" MAST search request should look like.

PART II: Retrieving Data
========================

Once you are satisfied with your search parameters as shown in Figure 3,
then click on the *Search* button. This will result in a new screen with
*HST Search Results* at the top of the web page. Figure 4 show the
results for this STIS query.

.. figure:: figures/archives/stis_search_results.png

   Figure 4: This figure shows the results from the STIS search.

Note that in Figure 4 all of the datasets are marked for retrieval,
which is done by clicking on the *Mark All* button. If you are satisfied
with the datasets that are marked for retrieval, then click on the
*Submit marked data for retrieval from STDADS* button. The resulting
webpage is shown in Figure 5.

.. figure:: figures/archives/hst_retrieval_options.png

   Figure 5: This is what the "Retrieval Options" web page looks like.

There are several options for the type of delivery, the type of data
requested, and an option for overriding default parameters. For this
training exercise we want to retrieve the calibrated data and the
uncalibrated data, which includes the *raw* and *wav* extensions (needed
to reduce STIS data with ``calstis`` later in the training). You request the
data by ticking the "\ *Calibrated*\ " and "\ *Uncalibrated*\ " boxes
under "Science Files Requested" or by entering the specific extensions
you want in the "or enter a specific extension" box.

We will review two delivery options, **STAGE** and **SFTP**. The first
delivery option is to stage the data. For this option, the data will be
written to the Archive staging disk. You will be able to pull from the
staging disk using FTP and logging in with your archive username and
password. The other delivery option is to SFTP the data directly to a
destination you provide.

**STAGE option:** To get data via the stage option, enter your Archive
username and password, make your desired science file selections and
click the "\ *Send retrieval request to ST-DADS"* to submit your
request. After your request is processed by MAST, you should get two
emails: the first will tell you that your data is being retrieved and
the second will tell you that your data is staged (once the retrieval is
complete). The second email will give you instructions on how and where
to get your data. Because of the options that we chose for retrieval, we
will have to use ftp to get the data from the MAST servers.

The following commands show how to do this. Assuming that you are in your
working directory::

   > ftp stdatu.stsci.edu
   Name (Enter archive username)
   Password: (Enter archive password)
   ftp> binary
   (n.b. if binary is not set, the retrieved data will be corrupted)
   ftp> prompt
   ftp> cd /stage/<username>/<data location>
   ftp> mget *.fits

Entering these commands should download all of the raw and wav files
from the ftp server to your current working directory. To exit the ftp
connection, simply type, "exit".

**SFTP option:** Enter your Archive username and password and make your
science file selections as before. Now select "*sftp (OpenSSH v2)*".
In the "*Destination*" column, enter your IP address (or, if you know it, ``yourcomputername.stsci.edu``)
next to "*Hostname*", the directory you want the data placed, and the
username and password for the machine where the directory is located.
Click the "*Send retrieval request to ST-DADS*" to submit your
request. A test file will show up in the destination you specified
(deleted automatically). An email will be sent letting you know your
request was received and another email is sent when the data has been
delivered.

.. figure:: figures/archives/hst_retrieval_options_sftp.png

   The selections needed to retrieve data over SFTP.

You should now be familiar with searching for, and retrieving HST data
through MAST. Good job! Next, we will explore a few additional ways to
search for and retrieve HST data.

PART III: Alternative Archive Interfaces
========================================

Hubble Legacy Archive
---------------------

The HLA can be found at
`http://hla.stsci.edu/ <http://hla.stsci.edu/>`__. This archive
contains all of the same data you can retrieve through MAST, but the
data has been fully calibrated, aligned and drizzled within the same
visit, and mosaics have been produced from multiple visits. Preliminary
photometry and astrometry has also been performed on detections within
the field of view using DAOphot and SExtractor. There are essentially 6
product "levels" found within the HLA and they are:

 - *Level 1* - data are the individual exposures, projected ("drizzled") onto a common frame for each visit.
 - *Level 2* - data are the combined images (exposures with the same filter, same camera, and within the same visit).
 - *Level 3* - images are deep combined images or mosaics creating by combining data taken in different visits to the target.
 - *Level 4* - data are false color images (a combination of two or three colors, depending on what is available). They are included with other selections to help users assess data quality.
 - *Level 5* - data are the community-contributed high-level science products (HLSP).
 - *Level 0* - (calibrated, unprocessed) are not available for direct searches but may often by found using the *More...* link.

A "Frequently Asked Questions" section and instructions on how to search the archive can be found at `http://hla.stsci.edu/hla\_helpcenter.html <http://hla.stsci.edu/hla_helpcenter.html>`__.

What we are going to do now is retrieve source lists from the HLA. These
source lists contain astrometric and photometric data that has been
generated using DAOphot and SExtractor. We are going to be searching the
HLA by using proposal ID numbers (note that there are many ways to
search the HLA and what we will do is just one of them). These proposal
IDs are: 9443, 10775, 9662, and 9453.

Source lists can ultimately be used to make color-magnitude diagrams
(CMDs). If we were to make CMDs using the source lists, we would need
data with two different filters within the same visit. Let us retrieve
such data. The first step is to go to the web page at
`http://hla.stsci.edu/hlaview.html <http://hla.stsci.edu/hlaview.html>`__
and click on the "advanced search" button. Enter the proposal ID number
"10775" next to "Proposal ID". The web page should look like Figure 6.
If you are happy with your search parameters, then click on the *Search*
button. Note that despite the fact that we have requested a search on
all the HST instruments, we will only get results that pertain to the
proposal ID that we have entered and any instrument used within a
particular proposal.

.. figure:: figures/archives/hla_search.png

   Figure 6: This is what the search form should look like before you
   click on the "Search" button.

After you click on the *Search* button, you will get a web page that has
the same set-up as Figure 6 but with the search results below it. Figure
7 shows a subset of the search results.

.. figure:: figures/archives/hla_search_results.png

   Figure 7: This is what the search form should look like after you click on the "Search" button. Note that this is only a lower portion of the actual web page.

Since we want two filters from the same visit and within a particular
proposal, all the columns in Figure 7 (RA, Dec, Level, etc.) must have
the same values except for Spectral\_Elt, Dataset, and StartTime.
Although it is preferable to have NExposures and ExpTime to be the same
in making a CMD, this does not have to be the case for our purposes.

Use the search forms under the column names to located data for Target
'NGC6809' and Spectral\_Elt 'F606W' and 'F814W'. When you have found all 
four appropriate datasets, you can retrieve them by clicking on either 
the DAOphot or SExtractor links and these will be put into a shopping 
cart. Figure 8 shows where the shopping cart is located (middle of web page).

.. figure:: figures/archives/hla_shopping_cart.png

   Figure 8: This figure shows the shopping cart in yellow. This can be found in roughly the middle of the web page. Note that this is only a portion of the actual web page.

Click on the shopping cart to get Figure 9.

.. figure:: figures/archives/hla_shopping_cart2.png

   Figure 9: This figure shows what is in the shopping cart. This can be found in roughly the middle of the web page. Note that this is only a portion of the actual web page.

Make sure that you have the data that you want and click on *Fetch HLA
Data*. This will be downloaded as a zip. The file should look something
like this: ``HLADATA-<numbers>.zip``. Unzip the data and view the contents.

You should see some text files (.cat for example) in there that contain the 
source lists. For a quick look, open them in an editor of your 
preference in Terminal.

After completing this training, please **give one of the source lists
that you retrieved to your instructor**.

Starview
--------

Starview is an excellent query tool to search for HST data. This query
tool allows a user to search on numerous parameters that are not
available through the HST MAST search form. The basic web page can be
found in Figure 10, which shows a STIS Instrument search form. The web
address is:
`http://starview.stsci.edu/web/ <http://starview.stsci.edu/web/>`__.

.. figure:: figures/archives/starview_default.png
   :alt: The Starview search form for STIS

   Figure 10: This is the default configuration for Starview with a STIS Instrument search form.

Under the STIS folder on the left side of the window, select the *STIS
Instrument* search form and make a copy of it by clicking on the button
*Copy* button positioned at the top and in the middle of the webpage,
under *Screen Toolbar*. This should create a new *STIS Instrument
(Copy)* search form. Figure 11 portrays what you will see. Note that the
copy that we just made is highlighted in blue in the top diagram of
Figure 11 and this copy is what is shown in the bottom diagram of Figure
11. Working from the copy search form, we can edit this form to search
on only certain parameters. We click on the *Edit* button and get what
is found in Figure 12.

You will notice two immediate differences between
Figures 11 and 12. The first difference can be found in the top diagrams
of both figures. There are two tabs (*Screens* and *Fields*) that can be
selected. In Figure 11, the *Screens* tab is chosen, while in Figure 12
the *Fields* tab is chosen. This is because we can add fields to the
search form if they are not in the default settings. The second
difference can be found in the two bottom diagrams in Figures 11 and 12.
This second difference is seen in the red "X"s that are found in Figure
12's bottom diagram but not in the bottom diagram of Figure 11. These
red "X"s allow us to delete parameters that we do not want to use in our
search form.

What we will do now is to remove any parameters that we do
not need (note that we do not *have to* delete parameters that we do not
want, this example is for illustrative purposes only). We will be
searching on proposal ID, amplifier, dataset name, and exposure time.
However, notice that when we have deleted all of the parameters except
for these four, we find that there is no parameter entry for the
amplifier.

This is where the *Fields* tab becomes useful. Under the
*Fields* tab, we find three directories: *catalog*, *cdbs*, and
*proposaldb*. Click on the sideways triangle to the left of *catalog*
and you will get a list of numerous directories. The directory that we
want is *stis\_ref\_data* and look for *CCD Amp Readout* under the
*label* column and *CCDAMP* under the *keyword column*, which will be in
the same row. Now click on the row with the correct label or keyword
that you are looking for and then drag to the search form at the right.
You should get what is found in Figure 13.

.. figure:: figures/archives/starview_form_view.png

   Figure 11: The left pane contains the list of available query "Screens". The right pane shows the "STIS Instrument (copy)" form we made.

.. figure:: figures/archives/starview_form_edit.png

   Figure 12: The left pane now shows "Fields" you can add to your query form. The right pane has been put in "Edit" mode from the *Screen Toolbar*, adding red delete buttons for each field.

.. figure:: figures/archives/starview_form_add_field.png

   Figure 13: This is what the edited search form should look like.

Now what we will do is use this abbreviated search form to search HST
archives for the data that we want. The parameter values that we will
use are: proposal ID 12769, amplifiers A and C, and exposure times, 0.0,
0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 2.3, 5.0, 60, and 1100 seconds. Note that we have not
entered a dataset name in *Dataset Name*. We need the *Dataset Name*
entry so that when the search is done, dataset names are returned. We
will need the dataset names in order to retrieve the data from the HST
archive.

As an example, use amp A and exposure time 0.3. Click on *Search* and
subsequently get a web page that looks like what is found in Figure 14.
We need to be careful here so that we get all of the data that we
requested. The way to do this is to look in the lower right hand portion
of the web page (see Figure 14 as well) and click on *View All* button.
This will display all of the datasets on one page. Now we will select
all of the datasets for retrieval by clicking on the first row with
datasets and then hold the shift key down on the keyboard and select the
last dataset entry. This will select all of the datasets and the rows
will have a blue background.

.. figure:: figures/archives/starview_search_results.png

   Figure 14: This figure shows what datasets are available for download.

After the desired datasets have been selected (all of them in this case)
click on the *Download Cart* button in the upper right of the web page
and you will get a drop down menu with various selections. Choose *Add
To Cart*. Once you have done this, the menu will disappear and you will
have to click on *Download Cart* again. Select *View Cart…* and then you
will get a GUI in the top center of the web page. Select *Proceed to
Checkout…*.

From here you can download the data like you normally would from MAST. (Note:
This was just an exercise showing how Starview works. You do not need to
actually download the data.)

MAST Data Discovery Portal
--------------------------

The `MAST Data Discovery Portal <http://mast.stsci.edu/>`_ (http://mast.stsci.edu/) is a newer, slicker interface to the Archive optimized for exploring existing archival data. If you're interested in a part of the sky, and are curious whether any MAST-affiliated missions observed it, this tool will show you.

.. figure:: figures/archives/mast_ddp_example.png

   Here's an `example query <http://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html?searchQuery=M83>`_ showing the galaxy M83 with matching HST data sets selected.

There are sophisticated features for faceting ("narrowing-down") and visualizing (FOV overlays on sky survey imagery, dataset thumbnails) HST, GALEX, SWIFT, and other missions' archives.

If that sounds like it might be useful to your work, have a look at their user guide: http://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/data/html/MastHelp.html. (There are also video tutorials for common tasks at the bottom of that page.)

PART IV: Understanding Calibration Header Keywords and Calibrating Data using PyRAF
===================================================================================

Now we turn our attention to the calibration of the STIS data that we
retrieved in Part II. First, we must initialize IRAF/PyRAF. In a
terminal, type the following commands::

   cd ~
   mkdir iraf
   cd iraf
   mkiraf
   (choose 'xterm')

We will do this using the SSBX version of PyRAF. If you're not already
in the SSBX environment, switch to it::

   ssbx

Ensure you've set up your ``.cshrc`` as detailed in :ref:`computer_setup_environment`. If your environment variables are not configured correctly, ``calstis`` will crash. (If you have any problems with this, feel free to ask for help from your instructor.)

To start PyRAF, simply type ``pyraf`` in the terminal.

You should get a screen in your terminal window that is similar to what
is found in Figure 16.

.. figure:: figures/archives/pyraf_startup.png

   Figure 15: An example of the PyRAF screen after starting up.

After PyRAF starts up, ensure that the needed packages are loaded by
typing::

   stsdas
   hst_calib
   stis
   onedspec

Now ``cd`` to the directory in which you downloaded the STIS data. We need
to inspect the headers of the raw files (at this point you should only
have raw and wav extension files in the directory).

Perform a ``catfits`` on the image ``o8j502280_raw.fits``::

   --> catfits o8j502280_raw.fits

This will tell us what the FITS extension structure is for this file
(see Figure 17). Notice that this file has 7 extensions (0 through 6);
Extension 0 is the primary header, extensions 1 and 4 are science
extensions, extensions 2 and 5 are error extensions, and extensions 3
and 6 are data quality extensions. Each of these extensions serve a
different purpose and tell us useful information about the particular
image. For this exercise, we are primarily concerned with the
0\ :sup:`th` extension, which contains the primary header containing
keywords and metadata associated with the particular observation.

.. figure:: figures/archives/pyraf_catfits.png

   Figure 16: The FITS extension structure of o8j502280\_raw.fits as given by the catfits command.

We use imhead to inspect the primary header::

   --> imhead o8j502280_raw.fits[0] l+

For our purposes, we only want to check that the calibration switches
and the pathways for the calibration reference files are set correctly.
The proper header keyword values that are needed to reduce the raw data
can be found in Figure 18. There are three types of calibration
switches: PERFORM (do the requested calibration step), OMIT (do not do
calibration step), and COMPLETE (requested calibration step has been
completed). Inspection of the calibration switches show that they are
set correctly (for more information on each calibration step, see the
STIS Data Handbook reference).

.. figure:: figures/archives/pyraf_calstis_header_switches.png

   Figure 17: This shows the correct configuration in the raw image header that will produce calibrated STIS data.

Let us now calibrate some raw STIS data (remember that you need both the
raw and wav extension files in the same directory). This is easy to do
and requires only one command line entry::

   --> calstis *raw.fits

When calstis has finished running, there will be new files in your
directory with the extensions: *flt*, *crj*, *sx1*, and *sx2*. There are
two more extensions that are not produced from the raw datasets and
these are *x1d* and *x2d*. These are the same file formats as *sx1* and
*sx2* files but created from observations where CRSPLIT = 1 and
REPEATOBS are not applicable (i.e. there are no repeat observations of
the same target within a particular visit). The only extension that we
are interested is the *sx1* file, which is a table FITS file and
contains the data from the extracted spectrum.

Now we will use PyRAF to look at the reduced spectrum. First, we must
convert the one-dimensional spectra (*sx1* file) to a standard
one-dimensional spectral image (*imh* file) using the *tomultispec*
task. Choose a *sx1* file to operate on and convert the spectra. For
example::

   --> tomultispec o8j502280_sx1.fits o8j502280_sx1.imh

Now plot the spectra using the *splot* task::

   --> splot o8j502280_sx1.imh

Figure 19 shows the displayed spectra for this example. We will learn
more about tomultispec and splot in future PyRAF trainings.

.. figure:: figures/archives/pyraf_splot.png

   Figure 18: The plotted spectra for the o8j502280 dataset.

We have now retrieved STIS data from the archive, downloading only *raw*
and *wav* extension fits files. We inspected the calibration switches
and calibration reference files and produced calibrated data of which we
are interested in the *sx1* extension files. We used various PyRAF tasks
to plot our results.

We are now done. Good job! Note, however, that we
have barely scratched the surface of what can be done with MAST and
PyRAF. Feel free to examine any other datasets or databases that you are
interested in and if you have any questions please feel free to ask.

PART V: Some Additional Information
====================================

It should be obvious that we have neglected and glossed over many
details and abilities of both MAST and PyRAF. There are several PyRAF
commands that RIAs often use (not necessarily in conjunction with
calibration of data), namely:

 * catfits
 * imexam
 * imhead
 * imcalc
 * imarith
 * imstat
 * tread
 * tprint
 * imreplace

help is easy to find by typing ``help imhead``, for instance, in the
command line within PyRAF.

There are numerous documents that give instructions on how to reduce,
extract, and analysis astronomical data. Below is list (not complete by
any means) of useful IRAF/PyRAF documents:

 * A Beginner's Guide to Using *IRAF*
 * A User's Guide to CCD Reductions with *IRAF*
 * A User's Guide to Stellar CCD Photometry with *IRAF*
 * Specifications for the Aperture Photometry Package
 * A User's Guide to the *IRAF* Apphot Package
 * A Reference Guide to the *IRAF*/DAOPHOT Package
 * A User's Guide to Reducing Slit Spectra with *IRAF*
 * A User's Guide to Reducing Echelle Spectra With *IRAF*
 * Guide to the Slit Spectra Reduction Task DOSLIT
 * Guide to the Slit Spectra Reduction Task DOECSLIT

All of the above documents can be found at:
`http://iraf.noao.edu/docs/photom.html <http://iraf.noao.edu/docs/photom.html>`__
and
`http://iraf.noao.edu/docs/spectra.html <http://iraf.noao.edu/docs/spectra.html>`__.
All of the IRAF/PyRAF documents can be found at:
`http://iraf.noao.edu/docs/docmain.html <http://iraf.noao.edu/docs/docmain.html>`__.
There are, of course, varying opinions on IRAF's abilities to perform
the aforementioned tasks, but this is an excellent place to start, and
as I am sure you are aware, how the data is reduced depends on what the
scientific requirements demand.

Conclusion
==========

Thank you for completing the Archives Training! Please send your trainer
