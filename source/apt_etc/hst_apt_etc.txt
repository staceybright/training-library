Astronomer's Proposal Tool
============================

The Astronomer's Proposal Tool (APT) is a software package used by the institute and external users alike
for planning HST (and soon, JWST) proposals. It consists mainly of the following:

    - Editors used in filling out Phase I and Phase II proposals
    - An Orbit Planner tool used to test the viability of a desired observation in a Phase II proposal
    - A Visit Planner tool used for visualizing and determining the ability to schedule a desired observation
    - A Bright Object tool used for performing checks for brightness above instrument safety thresholds
    - A tool based on ALADIN used for simulating what data may look like for the planned observation

To get started with learning how to use APT, first download the app by going to the
APT webpage using the 'website' link above and clicking on the appropriate link on the right side of the
page under 'Install APT.' APT is also available internally (or by VPN) via /eng/apt/Mac,
but it's a good idea to have a copy of the app that doesn't depend on the Institute's /eng network mount.
Then use the "training videos" link above and watch and follow along with (on your machine)
the 'General' training videos. These tutorials will teach you how to use APT to prepare for a general
proposal. For additional help, see the APT Overview presentation slides.

.. admonition:: Exercise 1
   :class: note

   Try to create a Phase I and a Phase II proposal based on these parameters:

        Instrument: COS

        Target: M31

        Visits: 3

        Orbits: 2, 4, 5 (for each visit)

        Grating: G130M

        Cenwave: 1327

    For the Phase I: include some notes for the abstract and add a CO-I.

.. warning::

    Do not hit the submission button. You Don't actually want this to be reviewed...




Exposure Time Calculator
========================

The Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) is a software tool that does exactly what the name implies, and each
instrument has it's own tool. ETC is a simulator used in helping users of HST or JWST
instruments figure out what exposure times they need to fulfill certain requirements for
their science such as Signal to Noise, the type of target they want to observe, background levels, etc.
It also generates handy plots for understanding the instrument's expected performance under the conditions that are input.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: note

    In the case of ETC there's not much training that's required. It's a simple form that you
    fill out based on parameters that you want/expect for your observation.

    Go try it out! Start with the default values. What do you get?

    Find your instrument's ETC and submit 3 (default plus two different submissions)
    different forms with different parameters.
    Return to your trainer with the following:

        Start with the default values. What do you get?

        Parameters used (with the fields) for each submission
        Results page for each submission
        
        Any plots that are generated

        OPTIONAL: Note any warnings that you may get. Try to figure out why you got them
        and how to resolve them
