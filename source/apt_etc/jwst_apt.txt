Astronomer's Proposal Tool
============================

The Astronomer’s Proposal Tool (APT) is an integrated software package for constructing, validating and submitting
proposals for the Hubble Space Telescope and will also be used for James Webb Space Telescope proposals. Observers
have the responsibility of creating and submitting proposals that are accurate, feasible and schedulable. The
computer software used to schedule and execute observations can interpret the proposal information only if it
is in the proper format. APT helps with this process by providing a  collection of tools with graphical user interface
(GUI) for the user. APT was first released in 2002. 


HST-APT has two modes that correspond with the two-phase proposal process. Focus of Phase I is to make the case for
the science to be done. Phase II (details of observations) is only done for accepted proposals. The JWST branch has
been developed to be consistent with the single-phase (single-stream) proposal approach. For JWST once an instrument
and observing mode (or template) are selected, the specific parameters that need to be specified for that mode are
presented to the user. Users specify exposure parameters that provide the necessary S/N for their science requirements.
Using a set of rules and assumed overhead times APT calculates the total science exposure time being requested in the
observations.


APT team has created extensive documentation that can be accessed from the links below. The HST and JWST versions of APT
are very similar. The differences between the two are are highlighted in `JWST What’s New page <http://apst.stsci.edu/apt/external/help/jwst_documentation/Getting-Started.html>`__ and
described in the APT overview slides.

**How to get the new version: (From periodic APT release notes by Karla Peterson)**


You can install APT on your home machine just as the outside users do (go to
http://apt.stsci.edu). But at work, APT is conveniently preinstalled on our
Mac and Linux clusters. You do not have to do anything but bring it up again.
No reinstalling with every release. Sorry Windows users - we have to install.

Mac users can open the /eng/apt/Mac folder in the Finder and launch APT from
there. Alternatively, you can create an alias to the folder or app right on
your desk top.

Linux users can just cd to /eng/apt/Linux64 to find APT preinstalled for them
and can create aliases as well.

.. admonition:: Exercise
   :class: note

   Create a dummy JWST NIRISS AMI (Aperture Masking Interferometry) proposal based on the parameters listed below:
   (Some information in this program is adapted from SODRM program 3051)

   Please refer to the APT overview slides for additional help.

        **Instrument:** NIRISS

        **Template:** NIRISS Aperture Masking Interferometry 

        **Title:** Long wavelength follow-up of planets found by ground-based observatories.

        **Abstract and Proposal Description:** Enter any text (you would enter appropriate text for the real program)

        **Scientific Category:** Extrasolar Planets and Planet Formation

        **Science Keywords:** Exoplanet Host Stars, Extra-Solar Planets, Giant Planets

        **Targets:** HD 231776, HD 229863, HD 215904 (Use 'Fixed Target Resolver' and SIMBAD to add these targets), REFSTAR1 (Use 'New Fixed Target' and enter coordinates  297.8281093,10.30381967).

		   
        **Acq Fluxes** (micro-Jy): 1.47 e6, 1.52e6,  2.34e5, 1e7

        **Subarray:** SUB80

        **Readout Pattern:** NISRAPID

        **Observations:** Create four observations for these targets as shown in the table below.

    After creating the above observations create a Special Requirement to group observations 1, 2, 3 and 4 and choose options Non-interruptible, Exclusive  Use of Instrument.
    Find the meaning of Non-interruptible and Exclusive use of instrument special requirements using JWST Proposal Instructions.
    Create Target Confirmation Charts, run Visit Planner, view one of the observations with Aladin, look at the PDF Preview. Do you think the
    observations are schedulable? Are the coordinates correct for all targets?

    Send the aptx file to your trainer.
