Using IDL for astronomical data analysis
*****************************************

IDL stands for "Interactive Data Language." It is a complete computer language geared toward the interactive analysis and visualization of scientific and engineering data. It is used widely in astronomy, as well as many other fields, such as medical imaging, etc.

The intention of this tutorial is to provide the IDL basics to understand how to perform simple astronomical data analysis. We assume no previous knowledge of IDL, but at least a simple understanding of any other computer language.

.. warning::

   This document is no longer supported as STScI as a whole is moving towards Python. These sections are meant only to give a brief introduction. You can use the PDF as a reference as needed.

   For information and tips on how to translate IDL to Python, check out `this website <http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/idl-python-xref.pdf>`_. Note that this reference assumes
   that pylab has been imported instead of the typical prefixing with "np." or "plt."

   **Ask your trainer which sections to work through.**
