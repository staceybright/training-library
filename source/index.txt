   **To non-RIA readers:** These documents are designed for internal use only, and are not an official AURA/STScI publication. Information may be out of date, irrelevant, or contradict published documentation. Use at your own risk!

New Research & Instrument Analysts at STScI work with a variety of tools, depending on their instrument team and research assignments. Nevertheless, some things are so generally useful to RIAs that we've drawn up training documents to bring you up to speed on anything you haven't used before.

Training guides and exercises for new RIAs

.. tip::

   We do our best to keep these documents up to date, but they can diverge from reality occasionally. If you spot an error, `let us know <https://github.com/stsci-riab/riatraining/issues/new>`_ by telling your trainer or `reporting an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/stsci-riab/riatraining/issues/new>`_.

   (You'll get access to the RIAB GitHub site in the training module on :doc:`version_control`.)
