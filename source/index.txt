The Technical Staff Training Library

.. warning::

   **To non-STScI readers:** These documents are designed for internal use only, and are not an official AURA/STScI publication. Information may be out of date, irrelevant, or contradict published documentation. Use at your own risk!

The Research & Instrument Analysis branch has produced training documents for new hires that are now used for all new technical staff in the Instruments division at STScI. The Instruments Division also offers lectures on important topics (such as instruments, operations, and pipelines) whenever a large cohort of new hires arrives at STScI.

**If you've arrived with a large cohort:** Visit the `New hire training <https://confluence.stsci.edu/display/INSTraining/New+hire+training>`_ page, and select the appropriate schedule from the links there (e.g. "New hire training for technical staff (September 2016)" if that is the most recent).

**If you're arriving alone or with only a few other new hires:** you will work through materials in this library on your own with the help of trainers (listed on the `New hire training <https://confluence.stsci.edu/display/INSTraining/New+hire+training>`_ page) who can answer questions. When the next large cohort of new hires starts, you will join them for the lectures you haven't attended yet. (There is no need to repeat material you already worked through.)

***********
Core topics
***********

These core topics are recommended for all new hires. The following topics have exercises for self-directed study:

#. :doc:`computer_setup`
#. :doc:`version_control`
#. :doc:`archives`
#. :doc:`python/index`
#. :doc:`apt_etc/index`

*If you're already proficient in one or more of these areas, talk to your team lead or the INS management about making alternative arrangements.*

Some of the core topics are presented as short talks:

#. Instruments Division Orientation
#. Research & Instrument Analysis Branch Overview
#. Hubble Instrument Overviews (ACS, COS, STIS, WFC3)
#. JWST Instrument Overviews (NIRCam, NIRISS, NIRSpec, MIRI)
#. Telescopes Group Overview
#. Operations Flow for HST & JWST
#. Pipeline & Reference Files Overview
#. IR Detector Pipelines

Slides taken from previous training rounds are stored on the `INS New Hire Training page <https://confluence.stsci.edu/display/INSTraining/New+hire+training>`_.

Also, once you have finished the training exercises, you will be assigned a project that relates to your instrument team assignment.

.. tip::

   We do our best to keep these documents up to date, but they can diverge from reality occasionally. If you spot an error, `let us know <https://github.com/stsci-riab/riatraining/issues/new>`_ by telling your trainer or `reporting an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/stsci-riab/riatraining/issues/new>`_.

   (You'll get access to the RIAB GitHub site in the training module on :doc:`version_control`.)

*****************
Additional topics
*****************

Your team lead has selected a set of additional topics for you to complete. If you do not know which ones you will be doing, ask your training buddy for details. Research & Instrument Analysts are required to complete all of the additional topics.

#. :doc:`drizzle`
#. :doc:`photometry`
#. :doc:`pysynphot`

Some of the additional topics are presented as short talks or in-person training sessions:
