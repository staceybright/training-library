***************
Up The Ramp Sampling
***************

This training is meant to familiarize you with the behavior of IR detectors and the basic corrections that are needed for scientific observations.
In this training, you will have an introduction to the pipeline reductions of the HST instrument WFC3 also known as WF3.

.. note::

   This guide is maintained as a Jupyter notebook.


To begin, copy over the following directory to your central store location::

   cp -rfv /grp/hst/riab/training/up_the_ramp_sampling/WFC3_tutorial /user/$USER/WFC3_tutorial

Next, you will need to open the notebook named CalWF3_Inspector.ipynb located here::

  > cd /user/$USER/WFC3_tutorial/main/


Run the notebook and walk through the tutorial::

  > Jupyter notebook

.. admonition:: Exercise
   :class: note

   Plot counts vs. total integration time from the IMA file for the pixel in the tutorial.
   Describe the behavior of the signal. How is the pixel used for the final slope calculation?

.. tip::

  Use header keyword 'SAMPTIME' from each 'SCI' extension of the IMA file.
  Make sure to check the 'BUNIT' keyword.
