Roberto Avila has prepared some :download:`slides <downloads/pdf_guides/phot_training_current.pdf>` about photometry on Hubble images.

There are also :download:`exercises <downloads/notebooks/photometry_exercises.ipynb>`, presented in the form of a Jupyter Notebook file for you to download and run, that complement the slides and will introduce you to photometry on HST images with `photutils <https://photutils.readthedocs.io>`_.
