Improving These Documents
**************************

These documents live in a ``git`` repository, making it easy for you to modify them and share your changes with other RIAs. GitHub is the service we use to coordinate sharing and reviewing the changes. You can find the web interface to the repository at https://github.com/josephoenix/riatraining.

.. _making_and_previewing_changes:

Making and previewing changes
=============================

The first step to making a change is to clone the repository, giving you a local copy to work with::

   git clone git@github.com:josePhoenix/riatraining.git

This creates a ``riatraining`` directory in whatever folder you're in. The web pages you're reading now are automatically generated from the ``.txt`` files in the ``source`` subdirectory. To generate them on your computer, you need to install required packages from ``requirements.txt``::

   cd riatraining/
   pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs the program that builds the web pages from the source files, as well as components it depends on. To make a change, edit the ``.txt`` source for the document and then run::

   make html

The generated HTML for the webpages is now in ``build/html/``. You can open ``build/html/index.html`` (or another file) to see your handiwork.

See :ref:`sharing_doc_changes` for how to incorporate your changes in the published version.

.. _autobuilder:

A simpler workflow
------------------

There's a helper script that will rebuild (``make html``) the pages every time you edit and save a file. Run ``python autobuilder.py`` from your terminal, and a browser window will pop open pointing to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

While the autobuilder is running, any changes to .txt files will trigger a rebuild when you save them. Make your edits, save, and refresh the page in your browser to see your changes.

Quit the autobuilder by interrupting it with :kbd:`Control-c`.

Finishing your RIA training
===========================

For the last part of your training, you will make a small change to these documents and publish your changes for all to see.

Editing the trainee list
------------------------

:doc:`trainees` is a page on this site listing all the RIAs who have completed this training. You will edit this page to add your name to the list. Recall from :doc:`version_control` that it's a good idea to make changes on a separate branch. Make a new branch called ``last_exercise_yourlastname``.

.. admonition:: Exercise: Add your name to "Past RIA Trainees"
   :class: note

   Edit the source file to add your name in the appropriate section.

Verify your changes worked using either the :ref:`autobuilder script <autobuilder>` or ``make html``. Once you're satisfied, commit the changes to your branch.

.. admonition:: Exercise: Push your changes for review
   :class: note

   Push your changes to a new branch on the origin repository. (i.e. ``git push origin last_exercise_yourlastname``).

Making a pull request on GitHub
-------------------------------

GitHub would not stop you from merging your own edits, but it is considered good practice to give other collaborators a chance to review your changes.

Once you have pushed to a new branch, when you visit https://github.com/josephoenix/riatraining you will see a new green icon to "compare and pull request".

**Congratulations! You've finished the exercise-based part of the training. Next up, talk to your trainer about your project and report.**

Bonus: fix a problem you noticed in these documents
===================================================

Sometimes, things in the training documents are out of date by the time the newest hires see them. Other times, certain topics need clarification or a typo needs to be corrected. If you noticed something to improve during the training, you are highly encouraged to make your own edits and propose them through a pull request!

.. admonition:: Exercise: Improve something in these documents
   :class: note

   Find something that needs improvement, make your edits on a new branch, and open a pull request to the training repository.

   (Not sure how to format something? See :ref:`rest_primer`, below.)

Creating an entirely new document
=================================

Simply create a new ``.txt`` file in the ``source/`` directory with the desired name. To have it show up from the homepage, you will also want to make a link to it in ``index.txt`` (for ``foo.txt``, the link would be ``:doc:`foo```), and add it to the "toctree" at the end of that file (again, without the ``.txt`` extension).

.. _rest_primer:

Writing with reST
=================

The training documents are formatted in *reST* (reStructuredText). reST is a markup language (like e.g. LaTeX), meaning that there are "source" files and a program that "compiles" them into pages with your formatting applied.

Writing with reST (reStructuredText) is a lot like writing a plain-text email. Bullet points are just asterisks at the beginning of a line, emphasis is accomplished by putting asterisks on either side of a word, and so forth. If you're not sure how some formatting was achieved in these documents, just have a look at the ``.txt`` source file for that document!

Here are some very common patterns for quick reference:

+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|Type of formatting                 | Example code                                                |
+===================================+=============================================================+
| Bold                              | |  ``**bold text**``                                        |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Italic/emphasis                   | | ``*emphasized text*``                                     |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Chapter heading                   | | ``*****************``                                     |
|                                   | | ``Chapter Heading``                                       |
|                                   | | ``*****************``                                     |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Section heading                   | | ``Section Heading``                                       |
|                                   | | ``=================``                                     |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Link to another training document | | ``:doc:`filename_without_extension```                     |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Link to a section heading         | At the heading you want to link to:                         |
|                                   |                                                             |
|                                   | | ``.. _your_reference_name:``                              |
|                                   | |                                                           |
|                                   | | ``Section Heading``                                       |
|                                   | | ``=================``                                     |
|                                   |                                                             |
|                                   | For the link itself:                                        |
|                                   |                                                             |
|                                   | | ``:ref:`link text <your_reference_name>```                |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Link to a web page                | | ```text of link <http://example.com/>`_``                 |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

You can also insert an exercise prompt with this code::

   .. admonition:: Exercise: Add a new prompt
      :class: note

      Indent your exercise instructions with three spaces, and
      leave a blank line after the ``admonition`` line but
      before the instructions

Which would look like this:

.. admonition:: Exercise: Add a new prompt
   :class: note

   Indent your exercise instructions with three spaces, and leave a blank line
   after the ``admonition`` line but before the instructions

To include a code listing (e.g. a snippet of python or terminal output), use the ``::`` marker at the end of the preceding paragraph, as in the following example::


   Blah blah preceding paragraph or sentence. Now refer to this code::

      if __name__ == "__main__":
          app = Application()
          app.run()

   Continuing prose description following after a blank line.
