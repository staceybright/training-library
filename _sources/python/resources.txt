More about Python Coding Styles and Best Practices
==================================================

At various points in this training, we have touched on some of the "best practices" that are recommended when coding in Python. Two good resources for learning more about these best practices are PEP-8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), which covers general conventions, and PEP-257 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/), which discusses docstrings. If you have an interest in scripting in Python, please take the time to review these two documents.

Mailing Lists
-------------

These Python themed STScI e-mail lists are available through the Outlook Web App (OWA):

-  **pylunch**: A mailing list for a lunch group that presents and discusses
   Python related material.

-  **python-interested**: A mailing list usually used to discuss bugs,
   fixes, and how to do some outrageous tasks that astronomers come up
   with.

Slack Channels
--------------

The STScI slack is RIFE with helpful Python discussions:

- **python**: A channel to discuss Python best practices, tools, and bugs.

- **code-review**: Coordinates (predominately Python) code review, posts
  interesting tutorials, and sometimes trouble-shooting questions.

- **statistics**: Discussions of statistics -- mostly Python tools.
