This repository contains source code for training documents for new Research & Instrument Analysts at the Space Telescope Science Institute.

If you are looking for a place to **read** the documents, you can find the latest internally published version at TODO.

If you want to **edit** the documents, read on.

This is a Sphinx-based documentation project. Thsi means that the document sources are written in *reST*, or reStructuredText, a document authoring language. (These are the ``.rst`` files found under the ``source`` directory.) The program that turns reST sources into pretty HTML pages is called ``Sphinx``, and is written in Python. The process of turning the sources into HTML pages is called "building" the docs, and can be done manually with the included ``Makefile`` or automatically when you save your edits (using ``autobuilder.py``).

Full instructions for setting up your system to let you edit the docs are in ``improvements.rst``, or online at TODO.
