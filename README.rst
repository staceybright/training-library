.. warning::

   These documents are designed for internal use only, and are not an official AURA/STScI publication. Information may be out of date, irrelevant, or contradict published documentation. **Use at your own risk.**

This repository contains the source code for training documents for new Research & Instrument Analysts and other technical staff at the Space Telescope Science Institute.

If you are looking for a place to **read** the documents, you can find the latest internally published version at http://stsci-riab.github.io/riatraining/.

If you want to **edit** the documents, read on.

This is a Sphinx-based documentation project. This means that the document sources are written in *reST*, or reStructuredText, a document authoring language. (These are the ``.txt`` files found under the ``source`` directory.) The program that turns reST sources into pretty HTML pages is called ``Sphinx``, and is written in Python.

Full instructions for setting up your system to let you edit the docs are in ``source/editing_these_documents.txt``, or online at http://stsci-riab.github.io/riatraining/editing_these_documents.html.
